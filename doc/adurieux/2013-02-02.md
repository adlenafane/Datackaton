## Create base classes

Created a BaseCommand class to emulate django commands.

Imported a SQLLite cache to cache calls on the Wikipedia APIs.
Requires to create a blank file under :

# Retrieve data from DB Pedia

Excellent tutorial here :

## Wrappers for SparQL 

A good tutorial : http://www.xml.com/lpt/a/1628
The wrapper we use : http://sparql-wrapper.sourceforge.net/

Base syntax : 

```
PREFIX table: <http://www.daml.org/2003/01/periodictable/PeriodicTable#>
SELECT ?name
FROM <http://www.daml.org/2003/01/periodictable/PeriodicTable.owl>
WHERE { 
    ?element table:name ?name. 
}
```

# Install Neo4j

## Indexes

Noe4j does not automatically creates indexes. It has to be configured in 

```
nano neo4j-community-1.9.M04/conf/neo4j.properties
# Enable auto_indexing on nodes for data "name"
```

Note that the index is only built from the point when you create it. 
Older nodes won't have it.

## Server

You can run a neo4j server this way :

```
cd /var/db/neo4j/neo4j-community-1.8.1
bin/neo4j start
```

Note that the database will be saved to the following directory (beware, it's not
simply in the data folder !!)

```
cat conf/neo4j-server.properties | grep database.location
```

## GUI

The Rabbithole GUI is even better. It cannot run at the same time as the server,
since they will try to lock the data files. 

```
java -cp "target/neo4j-console-jar-with-dependencies.jar" org.neo4j.community.console.Console 7474 /var/db/neo4j/neo4j-community-1.9.M04/data/graph.db/ expose
```

Once again, beware : the data file path is very specific.
